    'about.text': 
    `
    <p class="mb-4">I graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Sciences and Data Science.  
    I am now pursuing a Master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, San Diego, specializing in Computer Engineering.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">My main interests lie in machine learning and signal processing, and I am eager to gain more hands-on research and industry experience in these areas.  
    I am currently seeking internship or research opportunities for Summer 2026, and would be glad to connect if my background and skills align with your needs.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Looking ahead, my goal is to advance the application of machine learning methods in areas such as biomedical signal analysis and audio processing.  
    I am particularly motivated by projects that transform raw, complex signals into actionable insights, and I value approaches that combine rigorous data processing with clear, impactful visualization.</p>

        `This app was developed to help native English speakers strengthen their auditory plasticity and 
        learn to distinguish sounds that are unfamiliar in their language. 
        It featured three modes of training, with options for both perception and production practice. 
        As part of the project, I worked on analyzing tonal data, performing data cleaning, and preparing 
        a structured dataset that was later used to train a machine learning model. I've also collaborated with 
        project members in developing the user interface of the application.`,
